<h2><a name="hexdump">Hex Dump Viewer</a></h2>

<p>You can use this to view the contents of the project data file
by double-clicking the "bytes" column, or with Actions &gt; Show Hex Dump.
The viewer is displayed in a "modeless" dialog that does not
prevent you from continuing to work with the project.  If you
double-click a different line in the project, the viewer will automatically
highlight those bytes.</p>

<p>You can also use this to view the contents of arbitrary files by
using Tools &gt; Hex Dump.  There is no fixed limit on the number of
viewers you can have open simultaneously.  (Be aware that the viewer
currently loads the entire file into memory, and you will run out of room
eventually.  Not coincidentally, the viewer has a size limit of 16MiB
per file.)</p>

<p>You can select lines with the mouse as you would in any other list
view.  Ctrl+A selects all lines.  Ctrl+C copies the selected lines to
the system clipboard.</p>

<p>The "character conversion" selector allows you to choose how the
bytes are converted to characters for the Text column.  Choose from
the usual set of encodings.</p>

<p>If "ASCII-only dump" is not checked, non-printable bytes are shown in
the ASCII dump as a middle dot ('&#183;').  If the box is checked,
non-printable bytes are represented by a period ('.') instead.  The
use of non-ASCII characters makes the dump unambiguous when unprintable
characters are mixed with periods, but the lines may be unsuitable for
pasting in some forums.</p>

<p>If "always on top" is checked, the window will stay above all other
windows that don't also declare that they should always be on top.  By
default this box is checked when displaying project data, and not checked for
external files.</p>


<h2><a name="ascii-chart">ASCII Chart</a></h2>

<p>This opens a window with the ASCII character set.  Each character is
displayed next to its numeric value in decimal and hexadecimal.  The
pop-up list at the bottom allows you to flip between standard and "high"
ASCII.</p>


<h2><a name="instruction-chart">Instruction Chart</a></h2>
<p>This opens a window with a summary of all 256 opcodes.  The CPU can
be chosen from the pop-up list at the bottom.  Undocumented opcodes are
shown in italics.</p>

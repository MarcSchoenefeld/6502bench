<h1>6502bench SourceGen: Code Generation &amp; Assembly</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Back to index</a></p>

<p>SourceGen can generate an assembly source file that, when fed into
the target assembler, will recreate the original data file exactly.
Every assembler is different, so support must be added to SourceGen
for each.</p>
<p>The generation / assembly dialog can be opened with File &gt; Assemble.</p>


<h2><a name="supported">Supported Assemblers</a></h2>

<p>SourceGen currently supports the following cross-assemblers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#64tass">64tass</a></li>
  <li><a href="#acme">ACME</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cc65">cc65</a></li>
  <li><a href="#merlin32">Merlin 32</a></li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="version">Version-Specific Code Generation</a></h3>

<p>Code generation must be tailored to the specific version of the
assembler.  This is most easily understood with an example.</p>
<p>If you write <code>MVN $01,$02</code>, the assembler is expected to output
<code>54 02 01</code>, with the arguments reversed.  cc65 v2.17 doesn't
do that; this is a bug that was fixed in a later version.  So if you're
generating code for v2.17, you want to create source code with the
arguments the wrong way around.</p>
<p>Having version-dependent source code is a bad idea, so SourceGen
just outputs raw hex bytes for MVN/MVP instructions.  This yields the
correct code for all versions of the assembler, but is ugly and
annoying.  So we want to output actual MVN/MVP instructions when producing
code for newer versions of the assembler.</p>
<p>When you configure a cross-assembler, SourceGen runs the executable with
version query args, and extracts the version information from the output
stream.  This is used by the generator to ensure that the output will compile.
If no assembler is configured, SourceGen will produce code optimized
for the latest version of the assembler.</p>

<h2><a name="generate">Generating Source Code</a></h2>

<p>Cross assemblers tend to generate additional files, either compiler
intermediaries ("file.o") or metadata ("_FileInformation.txt").  Some
generators may produce multiple source files, perhaps a link script or
symbol definition header to go with the assembly source.  To avoid
spreading files across the filesystem, SourceGen does all of its work
in the same directory where the project lives.  Before you can generate
code, you have to have assigned your project a directory.  This is why
you can't assemble a project until you've saved it for the first time.</p>

<p>The Generate and Assemble dialog has a drop-down list near the top
that lets you pick which assembler to target.  The name of the assembler
will be shown with the detected version number.  If the assembler
executable isn't configured, "[latest version]" will be shown instead
of a version number.</p>
<p>The Settings button will take you directly to the assembler configuration
tab in the application settings dialog.</p>
<p>Hit the Generate button to generate the source code into a file on disk.
The file will use the project name, with the ".dis65" replaced by
"_&lt;assembler&gt;.S".</p>
<p>The first 64KiB of each generated file will be shown in the preview
window.  If multiple files were generated, you can use the "preview file"
drop-down to select between them.  Line numbers are
prepended to each line to make it easier to track down errors.</p>



<h3><a name="localizer">Label Localizer</a></h3>
<p>The label localizer is an optional feature that automatically converts
some labels to an assembler-specific less-than-global label format.  Local
labels may be reusable (e.g. using "]LOOP" for multiple consecutive
loops is easier to understand than giving each one a unique label) or
reduce the size of a generated link table.  There are usually restrictions
on local labels, e.g. references to them may not be allowed to cross a
global label definition, which the localizer factors in automatically.</p>
<p>The localizer is somewhat experimental at this time, and can be
disabled from the
<a href="settings.html#app-settings">application settings</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="assemble">Cross-Assembling Generated Code</a></h2>

<p>After generating sources, if you have a cross-assembler executable
configured, you can run it by clicking the "Run Assembler" button.  The
command-line output will be displayed, with stdout and stderr separated.
(I'd prefer them to be interleaved, but that's not what the system
provides.)</p>

<p>The output will show the assembler's exit code, which will be zero
on success (note: sometimes they lie.)  If it appeared to succeed,
SourceGen will then compare the assembler's output to the original file,
and report any differences.</p>
<p>Failures here may be due to bugs in the cross-assembler or in
SourceGen.  However, SourceGen can generally work around assembler bugs,
so any failure is an opportunity for improvement.</p>


<h2><a name="quirks">Assembler-Specific Bugs &amp; Quirks</a></h2>

<p>This is a list of bugs and quirky behavior in cross-assemblers that
SourceGen works around when generating code.</p>
<p>Every assembler seems to have a different way of dealing with expressions.
Most of them will let you group expressions with parenthesis, but that
doesn't always help.  For example, <code>PEA label >> 8 + 1</code> is
perfectly valid, but writing <code>PEA (label >> 8) + 1</code> will cause
most assemblers to assume you're trying to use an alterate form of PEA
with indirect addressing (which doesn't exist).  The code generator needs
to understand expression syntax and operator precedence to generate correct
code, but also needs to know how to handle the corner cases.</p>


<h3><a name="64tass">64tass</a></h3>

<p>Code is generated for 64tass v1.53.1515 or later.
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tass64/">[web site]</a></p>

<p>Bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Undocumented opcode <code>SHA (ZP),Y</code> ($93) is not supported;
    the assembler appears to be expecting <code>SHA ABS,X</code> instead.</li>
  <li>COP and WDM are not allowed to have operands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quirks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The underscore character ('_') is allowed as a character in labels,
    but when used as the first character in a label it indicates the
    label is local.  If you create labels with leading underscores that
    are not local, the labels must be altered to start with some other
    character, and made unique.</li>
  <li>Labels starting with two underscores are "reserved".  Trying to
    use them causes an error.</li>
  <li>By default, 64tass sets the first two bytes of the output file to
    the load address.  The <code>--nostart</code> flag is used to
    suppress this.</li>
  <li>By default, 64tass is case-insensitive, but SourceGen treats labels
    as case-sensitive.  The <code>--case-sensitive</code> must be passed to
    the assembler.</li>
  <li>If you set the <code>--case-sensitive</code> flag, <b>all</b> opcodes
    and operands must be lower-case.  Most of the SourceGen options used to
    show things in upper case must be disabled.</li>
  <li>For 65816, selecting the bank byte is done with the back-quote ('`')
    rather than the caret ('^').  (There's a note in the docs to the effect
    that they plan to move to carets.)</li>
  <li>By default, the assembler assumes that the input is PETSCII, but
    doesn't convert characters in text strings.  So PETSCII source files
    generate PETSCII strings, and ASCII source files generate ASCII
    strings.  However, if you use the built-in "screen" encoding, you will
    get the wrong behavior if you compile an ASCII source without the
    "--ascii" command-line flag, because it expects to convert from
    PETSCII.  To get the behavior expected of a cross-assembler, it's
    necessary to pass "--ascii" and explicitly define an ASCII encoding
    for use with ASCII text strings.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="acme">ACME</a></h3>

<p>Code is generated for ACME v0.96.4 or later.
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/">[web site]</a></p>

<p>Bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The "pseudo PC" is only 16 bits, so any 65816 code targeted to run
    outside bank zero cannot be assembled.  SourceGen currently deals with
    this by outputting the entire file as a hex dump.</li>
  <li>Undocumented opcode $AB (<code>LAX #imm</code>) generates an error.</li>
  <li>WDM is not allowed to have an operand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quirks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The assembler shares some traits with one-pass assemblers.  In
    particular, if you forward-reference a zero-page label, the reference
    generates a 16-bit absolute address instead of an 8-bit zero-page
    address.  Unlike other one-pass assemblers, the width is "sticky",
    and backward references appearing later in the file also use absolute
    addressing even though the proper width is known at that point.  This is
    worked around by using explicit "force zero page" annotations on
    all references to zero-page labels.</li>
  <li>Undocumented opcode <code>ALR</code> ($4b) uses mnemonic
    <code>ASR</code> instead.</li>
  <li>Officially, the preferred file extension for ACME source code is ".a",
    but this is already used on UNIX systems for static libraries (which
    means shell filename completion tends to ignore them).  Since ".S" is
    pretty universally recognized as assembly source, code generated by
    SourceGen for ACME also uses ".S".</li>
  <li>Does not allow the accumulator to be specified explicitly as an
    operand, e.g. you can't write <code>LSR A</code>.</li>
  <li>Syntax for <code>MVN</code>/<code>MVP</code> doesn't allow '#'
    before 8-bit operands.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="cc65">cc65</a></h3>

<p>Code is generated for cc65 v2.17 or v2.18.
<a href="https://cc65.github.io/">[web site]</a></p>

<p>Bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PC relative branches don't wrap around at bank boundaries.</li>
  <li>[Fixed in v2.18] The arguments to <code>MVN</code>/<code>MVP</code> are reversed.</li>
  <li>[Fixed in v2.18] <code>BRK &lt;arg&gt;</code> is assembled to opcode
    $05 rather than $00.</li>
  <li>[Fixed in v2.18] <code>WDM</code> is not supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quirks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operator precedence is unusual.  Consider <code>label >> 8 - 16</code>.
    cc65 puts shift higher than subtraction, whereas languages like C
    and assemblers like 64tass do it the other way around.  So cc65
    regards the expression as <code>(label >> 8) - 16</code>, while the
    more common interpretation would be <code>label >> (8 - 16)</code>.
    (This is actually somewhat convenient, since none of the expressions
    SourceGen currently generates require parenthesis.)</li>
  <li>Undocumented opcode <code>SBX</code> ($cb) uses the mnemonic AXS.  All
    other opcodes match up with the "unintended opcodes" document.</li>
  <li>ca65 is implemented as a single-pass assembler, so label widths
    can't always be known in time.  For example, if you use some zero-page
    labels, but they're defined via <code>.ORG $0000</code> after the point
    where the labels are used, the assembler will already have generated them
    as absolute values.  Width disambiguation must be applied to operands
    that wouldn't be ambiguous to a multi-pass assembler.</li>
  <li>The assembler is geared toward generating relocatable code with
    multiple segments (it is, after all, an assembler for a C compiler).
    A linker configuration script is expected to be provided for anything
    complex.  SourceGen generates a custom config file for each project.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="merlin32">Merlin 32</a></h3>

<p>Code is generated for Merlin 32 v1.0.
<a href="https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/merlin/">[web site]</a>
<a href="https://github.com/apple2accumulator/merlin32/issues">[bug tracker]</a>
</p>

<p>Bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PC relative branches don't wrap around at bank boundaries.</li>
  <li>For some failures, an exit code of zero is returned.</li>
  <li>Some DP indexed store instructions cause errors if the label isn't
    unambiguously DP (e.g. <code>STX $00,X</code> vs.
    <code>STX $0000,X</code>).  This isn't a problem with project/platform
    symbols, which are output as two-digit hex values when possible, but
    causes failures when direct page locations are included in the project
    and given labels.</li>
  <li>The check for 64KiB overflow appears to happen before instructions
    that might be absolute or direct page are resolved and reduced in size.
    This makes it unlikely that a full 64KiB bank of code can be
    assembled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quirks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operator precedence is unusual.  Expressions are generally processed
    from left to right.  The byte-selection operators have a lower
    precedence than all of the others, and so are always processed last.</li>
  <li>The byte selection operators  ('&lt;', '&gt;', '^') are actually
    word-selection operators, yielding 16-bit values when wide registers
    are enabled on the 65816.</li>
  <li>Values loaded into registers are implicitly mod 256 or 65536.  There
    is no need to explicitly mask an expression.</li>
  <li>The assembler tracks register widths when it sees SEP/REP instructions,
    but doesn't attempt to track the emulation flag.  So if you issue a
    <code>REP #$20</code>
    while in emulation mode, the assembler will incorrectly assume long
    registers.  Ideally it would be possible to configure that off, but
    there's no way to do that, so instead we occasionally generate
    additional width directives.</li>
  <li>Non-unique local labels should cause an error, but don't.</li>
  <li>No undocumented opcodes are supported.</li>
</ul>

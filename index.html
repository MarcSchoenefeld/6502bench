<h1>6502bench SourceGen</h1>

<p>6502bench is a code development "workbench" for the 65xx family
of processors, including the 6502, 65C02, and 65802/65816.  It currently
features one tool, the SourceGen disassembler.</p>

<p><strong>SourceGen</strong> is an industrial-strength disassembler for 6502,
65C02, and 65816 programs.  Key features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully interactive point-and-click GUI.  Define labels, set addresses,
  add comments, and see the results immediately.  Add multi-line comments
  and have them word-wrapped automatically.</li>
  <li>The disassembly engine traces code execution, automatically finding all
  instructions reachable from a given starting point.  Changes to the
  processor status flags are tracked, allowing identification of branches
  that are always/never taken, accurate cycle count listings, and correct
  analysis of 65816 code with variable-width registers.</li>
  <li>Easy generation of assembly source code in popular formats (currently
  cc65 and Merlin 32).  Cross-assemblers can be invoked from the GUI to
  verify correctness.</li>
  <li>Symbols and constants are provided for ROM and operating system entry
  points on several popular systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyzer:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for 6502, 65C02, and 65816, including undocumented
    opcodes.</li>
    <li>Hinting mechanism allows manual identification of code, data, and
    inline data.</li>
    <li>Editable labels are generated for every branch destination and data
    target.</li>
    <li>Automatic detection and classification of ASCII strings and runs
    of identical bytes.</li>
    <li>Symbol files for ROM entry points, operating system constants, and
    other platform-specific data are stored in plain text files.</li>
    <li>Extension scripts can be defined that automatically reformat code and
    identify inline data that follows a JSR/JSL.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>User interface:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>"Infinite" undo/redo of all operations.</li>
    <li>Cross-reference tables are generated for every branch and data target
    address, as well as for external platform symbols.</li>
    <li>Instruction operand formats (hex, decimal, binary, ASCII, symbol) can
    be set for individual instructions.  References to nearby symbols are
    offset, allowing simple expressions like "addr + 1".</li>
    <li>Data areas can be formatted in various formats, including individual
    bytes, 16-bit and 24-bit words, addresses, or strings.</li>
    <li>Multi-line comments can be "boxed" for an authentic retro feel.</li>
    <li>Notes can be added that aren't included in generated output.  These
    also function as color-coded bookmarks.  Very useful for marking up a
    work in progress.</li>
    <li>Instruction summaries, including CPU cycles and flags modified, are
    shown along with a description of the opcode's function.</li>
    <li>Various aspects of the code display can be reconfigured, including
    upper/lower case, pseudo-opcode naming, and expression formats.  These
    choices are not part of the project definition, so everyone can view a
    project according to their own personal preferences.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Code generation:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Labels can be coaxed from global to local as allowed by the
    assembler.</li>
    <li>Symbols may be exported from one project and imported into another
    to facilitate multi-binary disassembly.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Miscellaneous:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>All data files are stored in text formats (primarily JSON).</li>
    <li>The project file includes nothing from the data file but a CRC.  This
    may allow the project to be shared without violating copyrights (subject
    to local laws).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>SourceGen is written in C# .NET, with the WinForms API for the user
interface.  The full source code for the project is available on GitHub,
licensed under Apache 2.0.</p>
